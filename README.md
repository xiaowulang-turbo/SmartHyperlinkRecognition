## ✨ Introduction

**Smart Text-to-Link Converter** is an efficient Chrome browser extension that automatically **scans and converts plain text URLs (like `http://example.com` or `www.google.com`) into clickable HTML hyperlinks (`<a>` tags)**.

No more copying and pasting text links into the address bar! This extension makes your browsing experience smoother, making all visible links instantly clickable.

## 🚀 Features

-   **🔗 Smart Link Conversion:** Real-time scanning of web page content, automatically recognizing and replacing text in the following formats:
    -   URLs with protocols (e.g., `https://`, `http://`, `ftp://`)
    -   Common domain formats without protocols (e.g., `www.example.com`, `example.com/page`)
    -   Email addresses (e.g., `user@domain.com`)
-   **⚡ Real-time Dynamic Processing:** Handles not only content loaded during page load but also new content dynamically loaded via AJAX or JavaScript (e.g., when scrolling or clicking "load more").
-   **🧠 Smart Exclusion:** Designed with intelligent rules that skip text already inside hyperlinks and content within `<pre>`, `<code>`, `<script>`, `<style>` tags to avoid breaking code display or page styling.
-   **🛠️ Highly Configurable:** Users can adjust recognition regex patterns, excluded HTML tags, and attributes for newly created links (e.g., whether to open in `target="_blank"` by default).
-   **🔒 Security & Performance:** Fast and efficient conversion process, all operations are performed locally, won't significantly impact browsing speed, and no data is collected.

### Version sync

The canonical version is the `version` field in `package.json`. Use `npm version patch|minor|major` to bump; the `version` lifecycle script runs `npm run sync-version`, which updates `extension/manifest.json`, `website/index.html`, and the Version badges in `README.md` / `README.zh-CN.md`. If you edit `package.json` manually, run `npm run sync-version` before committing (also runs from the pre-commit hook).

### Contributing Workflow

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/FixUrlRegex`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Improve URL matching regex'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/FixUrlRegex`)
5. Create a Pull Request

### Development Guidelines

-   Follow JavaScript ES6+ standards
-   Keep code concise and readable
-   Add necessary comments
-   Test new features on different websites

## 🐛 Known Issues
